# MCMC
In preparation for my new research project, here is a series of videos that I'm finding very useful to understand MCMC. The videos are from a series, and I've ordered them in the sequence in which I think they should be viewed.

## Accept-Reject Sampling
A method to produce approximate samples from an unkown underlying distribution, by using a simpler distribution that we can more easily sample from. It is really good, and the heart of MCMC, but it is highly inefficient in its simplest form.

## Markov Chains
A simple model that allows us to explore the behavior within a system that has a defined set of states that transition between each other defined by a transition probability (summarized in a transition matrix) that **only** depends on the previous state. A key concept is that of a **steady state**, which is the case where the probabilities for each one of the states converge to specific values if the chain is long enough.
